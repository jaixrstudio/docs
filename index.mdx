We came from **skyport**, the former 2nd largest game server panel We've taken our experience and and built something better - something that can compete with the wider market: Argon.

Argon has the architecture of **Pterodactyl**. But it's built for the modern world. No more PHP. Built from the ground up in TypeScript with a **powerful CLI, database management system** and loads of features that outcompete Pterodactyl or PufferPanel. And it's over **11x faster** in all of our test cases.
