We came from skyport, the former 2nd largest game server panel We've taken our experience and and built something better - something that can compete with the wider market: Argon.

Argon has the architecture of Pterodactyl. But it's built for the modern world. No more PHP. Built from the ground up in TypeScript with a powerful CLI, database management system and loads of features that outcompete Pterodactyl or PufferPanel. And it's over 11x faster in all of our test cases.
